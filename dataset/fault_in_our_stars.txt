And his eyes were the problem. He had some 
fantastically improbable eye cancer. One eye had been cut 
out when he was a kid, and now he wore the kind of thick 
glasses that made his eyes (both the real one and the glass 
one) preternaturally huge, like his whole head was basically 
just this fake eye and this real eye staring at you. From what 
I could gather on the rare occasions when Isaac shared with 
the group, a recurrence had placed his remaining eye in 
mortal peril. 

Isaac and I communicated almost exclusively through 
sighs. Each time someone discussed anticancer diets or 
snorting ground-up shark fin or whatever, he'd glance 
over at me and sigh ever so slightly. I'd shake my head 
microscopically and exhale in response. 

So Support Group blew, and after a few weeks, I grew to 
be rather kicking-and-screaming about the whole affair. 
In fact, on the Wednesday I made the acquaintance of 
Augustus Waters, I tried my level best to get out of Support 
Group while sitting on the couch with my mom in the third 
leg of a twelve-hour marathon of the previous season's 
America's Next Top Model, which admittedly I had already 
seen, but still.
